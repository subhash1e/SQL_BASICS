SQL commands are mainly devided in 4 types:

   1> DDL – Data Definition Language
   2> DQl – Data Query Language
   3> DML – Data Manipulation Language
   4> DCL – Data Control Language
   
   _______________________________________________________
   List of DDL commands: 

    CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
    DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.
    ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.
    TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
    COMMENT: This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
    RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.
    
    // generally not used by normal app user but is used by admin mostly
    // also, these commands help to make schema/structure of database but not data

   DQL (Data Query Language):

DQL statements are used for 
performing queries on the data
within schema objects. 


The purpose of the DQL Command is to get
some schema relation based on the query passed to it.

We can define DQL as follows it is a component of SQL
statement that allows getting data from the database 
and imposing order upon it. 
It includes the SELECT statement. 

This command allows getting the data out of the database
to perform operations with it. 

When a SELECT is fired against a table or tables
the result is compiled into a further temporary table,

which is displayed or perhaps received by the 
program i.e. a front-end.

List of DQL: 
SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.

The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present

in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this
includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL 
statement that controls access to data and to the database. Basically,
DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.

List of DML commands: 

    INSERT : It is used to insert data into a table.
    UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.
    DELETE : It is used to delete records from a database table.
    LOCK: Table control concurrency.
    CALL: Call a PL/SQL or JAVA subprogram.
    EXPLAIN PLAN: It describes the access path to data.

DCL (Data Control Language): 

DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights,
permissions, and other controls of the database system. 

List of  DCL commands: 

    GRANT: This command gives users access privileges to the database.
    REVOKE: This command withdraws the user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.

TCL – Transaction Control Language. So we will see in detail about TCL as well. TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database. 

List of TCL commands: 
 

    COMMIT: Commits a Transaction.
    ROLLBACK: Rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
    SAVEPOINT:Sets a savepoint within a transaction.
    SET TRANSACTION: Specify characteristics for the transaction.
